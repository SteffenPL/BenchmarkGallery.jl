# BenchmarkGallery.jl

Since Julia continues to improve, those best practices are subject to change.

This repository aims to collect educative benchmarks for *elementary* Julia snippets.

**Since all of this is new, the structur of how benchmarks are stored and presented
will change in the future.
As of now, I'm collecting ideas and feedback about how to produces shareable representative benchmarks.**


## What is not the aim of this repository

I am not interested in a comparison with other programming language nor in a judgemental comparison between packages.
