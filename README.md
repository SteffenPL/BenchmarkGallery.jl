# BenchmarkGallery.jl

Like any programming language, Julia has a collection of
special techniques to produces the fastes programms.
Since Julia continues to improve, those best practices are subject to change.

This repository aims to collect educative Benchmarks.
The aim is not to prove that X.jl is faster than package Y.jl, but rather
to focus on elementary Julia constructions.

**Since all of this is new, the structur of how benchmarks are stored and presented
will change in the future.

As of now, I'm collecting ideas and feedback about how to produces shareable representative benchmarks.**
